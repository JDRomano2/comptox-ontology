The MIE was identified as \u0026quot;\u0026nbsp;DNA topoisomerase II poisons (interfers with) topo II enzyme\u0026quot; and\u0026nbsp;epidemiological studies suggested that\u0026nbsp; exposure (in utero) to topoisomerases 2 may be involved in generation of the two\u0026nbsp;KEs, DNA double strand break and\u0026nbsp;MLL chromosomal rearrangement.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, based on the available evidence, infant leukaemia pathogenesis originates from a single, severe hit to a target cell during early intrauterine development. Whereas the limited epidemiological studies do not allow any firm conclusion on a possible role for chemicals in infant leukaemia (Pombo-de-Oliveira et al 2006; Ferreira et al 2013), exposures to chemicals able to induce MLL rearrangements through topoisomerase II (TopoII) \u0026ldquo;poison\u0026rdquo;, particularly etoposide and other TopoII \u0026ldquo;poisons\u0026rdquo;, including some bioflavonoids, have been suggested as agents promoting the driver genetic oncogenic event. Experimental models for infant leukaemia have been developed, but a wholly satisfactory model reproducing the phenotype and latency is not yet available.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eNevertheless, the anticancer drug etoposide can be considered as a model chemical for DNA topoisomerase \u0026ldquo;poison\u0026rdquo;. Acute leukaemia is an adverse effect recorded in etoposide-treated patients, showing MLL rearrangements that are in many ways analogous to those in infant leukaemia (Bueno et al 2009; Joannides et al 2010, 2011). Therefore the proposed AOP is supported by a number of convincing inferential evidences by means of using etoposide as a tool compound to empirically support the linkage between the proposed molecular initiating event (MIE) and the adverse outcome (AO). In the meanwhile, this AOP identifies several knowledge gaps, the main ones being the identification of the initiating cell and the investigation of TopoII poisons in a robust model; thus, the present AOP may be modified in future on the basis of new evidence. The authors recognize that additional elements are limiting the strenght of this AOP. Although a strong empirical support exists for the direct link between the MIE and the DNA double strand break and between this KE and the MLL translocation,\u0026nbsp;the empirical support for the indirect link between MLL translocation and the AO is mainly based on one chemical stressor and that essentiality data are also limited and difficult to generate;\u003cspan class=\"marker\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003ehowever, the biological plausibility for the proposed sequence of events for this AOP was considered strong.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/202.json"},{"id":98,"title":"5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT; SERT) inhibition leading to decreased shelter seeking and increased predation","short_name":"5-HTT block to incr. predation","corresponding_author":{"id":191,"email":"ksenia.groh@eawag.ch","created_at":"2013-10-18T07:49:02.000-04:00","updated_at":"2017-03-01T16:19:14.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/98.json"},{"id":97,"title":"5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT; SERT) inhibition leading to population decline","short_name":"5-HTT block to population decline","corresponding_author":{"id":120,"email":"fay.kellie@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-03-26T12:07:40.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-12-26T15:24:57.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eAnti-depressants such as fluoxetine and sertraline inhibit the reuptake of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) \u0026nbsp;by blocking the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), causing an increase in serotonin levels at neural junctions. In molluscs, serotonergic neurons are responsible for the termination of the catch state of muscle contraction (Muneoka and Twarog, 1983). During catch, muscles contract and are resistant to stretch well after excitation by acetylcholine has stopped and intracellular Ca2+ stores return to normal. Importantly, this prolonged contraction is accomplished with minimal (or no) use of energy. While additional phyla may also be able to undergo catch contraction, the role of serotonin in releasing the contraction state appears to be unique to mollusks (Muneoka and Twarog, 1983). In bivalves, catch is used to maintain valve (shell) closure and the presence of serotonin promotes the transition from the passive state to active valve movement; exposure to 5-HTT inhibitors has been observed to cause increased valve movement in swan mussels (Cunha and Machado, 2001). Increased valve movement not only depletes the organism\u0026rsquo;s energy reserves,but can cause excess water retention in the foot. This water retention is speculated to cause the foot detachment observed in mussels exposed to 5-HTT inhibitors (Cunha and Machado, 2001), although terrestrial gastropods also experience foot detachement (Pavlova 2001). Mussels in the unattached state expend greater energy [54] and are more susceptibility to predation than those attached to a substrate and clumped together (Casey and Chattopadhyay, 2008).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSerotonin has also been identified as a primary neurotransmitter used to control both ciliary and pedal foot locomotion in land and aquatic mollusks (Muneoka et al 1983, Pavlova 2001 , Gosselin 1961, Longley 2010). The specific impacts on locomotion, as well as the concentration-dependence, varies among molluscs because of differing physiology and life history strategies (Fong, 2014). In\u0026nbsp;various\u0026nbsp;bivalves, movement alterations may take the form of increased valve movement, locomotion and mantle display, and/or increased burrowing or burrowing (inappropriately) during daylight hours. The untimely and excessive movement of molluscs due to amplified serotonergic activity could feasibly enhance their visibility and/or diminish their energy reserves, making them more susceptible to predation. Recently, prolonged, low-dose (30-300 ng/L) exposures of mussels to fluoxetine were reported to cause decreases in filter feeding rates, energy reserves and growth (Peters 2016). Foot detachment mentioned above has also been attributed to disrupted coordination of pedal muscle cells and ciliated epithelium of the foot (Pavlova 2001).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/97.json"},{"id":195,"title":"5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT) inhibition leading to population increase","short_name":"5-HTT leading to population increase","corresponding_author":{"id":120,"email":"fay.kellie@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-03-26T12:07:40.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-12-26T15:24:57.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eIncreased serotonergic activity resulting from the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamin transporter (5-HTT; SERT; serotonin reuptake transporter) may result in increased population levels of certain mollusks, specifically invasive mussels.

Both AOPs include the KE of acetylcholine accumulation at the synapses. The downstream consequences of this KE are dependent on the tissue context and the specific type(s) of acetylcholine receptors present in those tissues. For example, one of the AOPs focuses on the effect of excess acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junctions of skeletal muscle which is mediated through impacts on nicotinic (N2, Nm) acteylcholine receptor. The other AOP considers impacts of acetycholine at the synapses in cardiac tissue, where muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M3) are known to be involved in regulation of heart rate. While these two AOPs are represented on the basis of their most plausible linkages to acute mortality, other known symptoms of acetylcholinesterase inhibition mediated through actions on other receptors and tissues are also known and may also play a role (see Russom et al. 2014). Overall, there is strong evidence supporting the linkage of acetylcholinesterase inhibition and acetylcholine accumulation with acute mortality, however, the evidence supporting a direct role of the intermediate organ level key events is less clear. This network of AOPs as a whole, including the indirect KERs depicted, supports the potential utility of in vitro or short-term in vivo measures of acetylcholinesterase inhibition for identifying chemicals with potential to cause systemic neurotoxicity at sub-narcotic concentrations. At present, quantitative understanding is not sufficiently complete to accurately predict apical outcomes or potency from in vitro measurements alone, and well known chemical initiators of these AOPs are known to require metabolic activation, suggesting chemical-specific ADME and toxicokinetic considerations will be strong determinant of quantitative outcomes along these AOPs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eTo date, review of the available literature regarding the role of intermediate key events is incomplete.

However, germ cell mutation analysis has been hampered by a lack of efficient tools. With the publication of the OECD test guideline TG488 (rodent transgene mutation assay) and new technologies (including next generation sequencing) this field is experiencing renewed focus. Indeed, regulatory approaches to assess germ cell mutagenicity were the focus of an IWGT workshop (Yauk et al., 2013). Of particular concern is the inability to address this endpoint through high-throughput screening assays (because spermatogenesis cannot be carried out in culture), and mutagenesis is an important gap in existing high-throughput tests.

The AOP requires uptake of the parent compound or metabolite in spermatogonia and interaction with DNA in those cells. DNA alkylation in male pre-meiotic germ cells is the molecular initiating event. A variety of different DNA adducts are formed that are subject to DNA repair; however, at high doses the repair machinery becomes saturated or overwhelmed. The fate of remaining adducts includes: (1) attempted DNA repair by alternative DNA repair machinery, or (2) no repair. Key event (KE) 1 is insufficient or incorrect DNA repair. Lack of repair can lead to replication of adducted DNA and ensuing mutations in male pre-meiotic germ cells (KE2). Mutations that do not impair spermatogenic processes will persist in these cells and eventually be present in the mature sperm. Thus, the mutations can be transmitted to the offspring (adverse outcome \u0026ndash; inherited mutations). It is well documented that mice and other animals exposed to alkylating agents develop mutations in male pre-meiotic germ cells that are then found in sperm, resulting in the transmission of mutations to their offspring.

The AOP is likely to be synergized during fasting, starvation or malnutrition events.\u0026nbsp; The MIE for this AOP involves antagonistic PPAR\u0026alpha; binding. The antagonist-binding to the PPAR\u0026alpha; regulatory complex causes the KE1, stabilization of co-repressor (SMRT or N-CoR) to PPARalpha ligand binding domain suppressing PPAR\u0026alpha; nuclear signaling (Nagy et al 1999, Xu et al 2002). PPAR\u0026alpha; is a transcriptional regulator for a variety of genes that facilitate systemic energy homeostasis (Mirza et al 2019, Kersten 2014, Evans et al 2004, Desvergne and Wahli 1999). As a result of the MIE and then KE1, the KE2 occurs where PPARalpha transactivation is inhibited for genes involved in the next 2 key events of the AOP: (KE3) decreased fatty acid beta oxidation (Desvergne and Wahili 1999, Kersten 2014, Dreyer et al 1992, Lazarow 1978, Brandt et al 1998; Mascaro et al 1998, Aoyama et al 1998, Gulick et al 1994, Sanderson et al 2008) and (KE4) decreased ketogenesis (Cahil 2006, Kersten et al 2014, Sengupta et al 2010, Desvergne and Wahli 1999). The KE3 results in decreased catabolism of very long chain fatty acids in peroxisomes and reduced catabolism of long, medium and short chain fatty acids in mitochondria reducing acetyl-CoA availability for use in oxidative phosphorylation-based ATP production (Evans et al 2004).\u0026nbsp; KE2 (and also potentially KE3) can drive KE4 resulting in decreased potential to repackage energy substrates as ketone bodies to support systemic energy demands during periods where the systemic energy budget is negative (Badman et al 2007, Potthoff 2009; Muoio et al 2002). The KE5, no change or a decrease in circulating ketone bodies becomes critical during cellular energy deficit conditions, a state where ketogenesis is typically induced to increase circulating ketone bodies providing metabolic fuel to sustain energy homeostasis (Cahill 2006). Physiological studies of the progression of human starvation have demonstrated the critical importance of ketogenesis, especially production of \u0026beta;-hydroxybutyrate, for meeting systemic energy demands by supplementing glucose to sustain the energy requirements of the brain (Cahill 2006, Owen et al 2005). PPAR\u0026alpha; knock can inhibit ketogenesis from fatty acid substrates in fasted mice reducing \u0026beta;-hydroxybutyrate production causing hypoketonemia (Badman et al 2007, Le May et al 2000, Muoio et al 2002).\u0026nbsp; Sustained negative energy budgets lead to KE6, an increase in muscle protein catabolism, with glutamine and alanine recycled for gluconeogenesis (Felig et al 1970A, Kashiwaya et al 1994). \u0026nbsp;If ketogenesis from fatty acid substrates fails to meet cellular energy needs, gluconeogenesis from alternative substrates becomes necessary including (KE 6) muscle protein catabolism \u003cem\u003ein situ\u003c/em\u003e supporting local muscle function and releasing glutamine (Marliss et al 1971) and alanine (Felig et al 1970A) for gluconeogenesis in kidney and liver to sustain systemic energy needs (Goodman et al 1966, Kashiwaya et al 1994, Cahill 2006).\u0026nbsp; Finally, the AO of body-weight loss occurs, which within the context of dynamic energy budget theory, decreases energy allocations to organismal maturation and reproduction (Nisbet et al 2000) and has been demonstrated to negatively affect ecological fitness (Martin et al 1987).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/6.json"},{"id":170,"title":"Anti-dopaminergic activity leading to mammary adenomas and carcinomas in the SD rat","short_name":"Anti-dopaminergic activity and mammary tumors","corresponding_author":{"id":319,"email":"wood.charles@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-08-18T16:59:44.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-04-17T09:41:23.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) outlines potential key events leading to a tumor outcome in standard carcinogenicity models.

However, sustained (direct or indirect) over-activation of these receptors can induce excitotoxic neuronal cell death. Indeed, mainly increased Ca2+ influx through NMDARs promotes many pathways of toxicity due to generation of free radical species, reduced ATP production, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein aggregation. Neuronal injury induced by over-activation of these receptors and the excessive Ca2+ influx is considered an early key event of excitotoxicity. Additionally, the excessive activation of NMDARs has been found to play a significant role in a variety of neurological disorders ranging from acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (Barenger et al., 2001) to chronic neurodegenerative diseases (Mehta et al., 2013). The proposed AOP is relevant to adult neurotoxicity testing. A molecular initiating event (MIE) has been defined as a direct binding of agonists to NMDARs or indirect, through prior activation of AMPARs and/or KARs resulting in sustained NMDARs over-activation causing excitotoxic neuronal cell death, mainly in hippocampus and cortex, two brain structures fundamental for learning and memory processes. The AOP is based on the empirical support describing (1) domoic acid (DomA) induced excitotoxicity triggered by indirect (through KARs/AMPARs) NMDARs over-activation leading to impaired learning and memory and (2) glufosinate (GLF) induced excitotoxicity that through direct binding to NMDARs causes convulsions and memory loss (Lanz et al., 2014). GLF is the methylphosphine analog of L-glutamate, used as a component of bactericidal and fungicidal herbicidal. DomA, a natural toxin that accumulates in mussels and shellfish is also an analogue of L-glutamate and among the most prominent features described after human exposure to DomA is memory impairment (Lefebvre and Robertson, 2010). DomA and GLF are described as the examples of the stressors due to large amounts of published data (especially in the case of DomA), however this AOP is relevant to any agonist that directly or indirectly cause NMDARs over-activation. Some of the known agonists selective for the NMDARs are derived from the naturally occurring amino acids such as ibotenic acid, homocysteine and l-aspartate and polyamines like spermidine.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/48.json"},{"id":17,"title":"Binding of electrophilic chemicals to SH(thiol)-group of proteins and /or to seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress during brain development leads to impairment of learning and memory","short_name":"Oxidative stress and Developmental impairment in learning and memory","corresponding_author":{"id":245,"email":"mzurich@unil.ch","created_at":"2016-03-24T12:01:00.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-01-17T17:51:11.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify\"\u003eThis Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) describes the linkage between binding to sulfhydryl(SH)-/seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress and impairment in learning and memory, the Adverse Outcome (AO). Binding to SH-/ seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress has been defined as the Molecular Initiating Event (MIE). Production, binding and degradation of Reactive Oxygen Radicals (ROS) are tightly regulated, and an imbalance between production and protection may cause oxidative stress, which is common to many toxicity pathways. Oxidative stress may lead to an imbalance in glutamate neurotransmission, which is involved in learning and memory. Oxidative stress may also cause cellular injury and death. During brain development and in particular during the establishment of neuronal connections and networks, such perturbations may lead to functional impairment in learning and memory. Neuroinflammation (Resident cell activation; Increased pro-inflammatory mediators) is triggered early in cell injury cascades and is considered as an exacerbating factor.

This leads to the second KE, a reduction in postsynaptic inhibition, reflected as reduced frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) or abolishment of GABA-induced firing action in GABAergic neuronal membranes. Consequently, the resistance of excitatory neurons to fire is decreased, resulting in the generation of a large excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), i.e., the third KE.\u0026nbsp;The large EPSP is reflected as a\u0026nbsp;spike (rise) of intracellular Ca\u003csup\u003e2+\u003c/sup\u003e observed in the affected region, where a large group of excitatory neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner.

Aneuploidy can affect any chromosome, and data in rodents suggest that neither aneuploid sperm nor aneuploid oocytes are selected against at fertilization. Therefore, an increase in germ cell aneuploidy is expected to result in an increase in aneuploid pregnancies. The etiology of human aneuploidy is still not well understood, although there is strong evidence supporting a preferential occurrence during female meiosis I and a positive correlation with maternal age. There is extensive evidence in animal models that chemicals can induce aneuploidy by interfering with the proper functioning of the meiotic spindle and other aspects of chromosome segregation. Over 15 chemicals have been shown to induce aneuploidy in mammalian oocytes and the majority of these chemicals interfere with microtubule dynamics during meiosis. In addition to these animal studies, there is also one reported case in which environmental exposure to trichlorfon, an organophosphate insecticide, was associated with a cluster of Down syndrome cases among women in a Hungarian community. The present AOP focuses on the induction of aneuploidy in mammalian oocytes as a consequence of chemical binding to tubulin (MIE). In this AOP, chemicals that bind to tubulin lead to the depolymerization of microtubules (KE1). Extensive microtubule depolymerization leads to meiotic spindle disorganization (KE2), which in turns lead to altered chromosome dynamics (KE3) and the generation of aneuploid oocytes (KE4). Aneuploid oocytes can be fertilized and generate aneuploid offspring (AO).

For this purpose, an in-depth survey of relevant scientific literature was carried out in order to identify intermediate steps and key events.

Both animal and human studies investigating NMDA itself, experiments with NMDAR antagonists and mutant mice lacking NMDAR subunits strongly support this statement (Rezvani, 2006). Activation of NMDARs results in long-term potentiation (LTP), which is related to increased synaptic strength, plasticity and memory formation in the hippocampus (Johnston et al., 2009). LTP induced by activation of NMDA receptors has been found to be elevated in the developing rodent brain compared to the mature brain, partially due to \u0026#39;developmental switch\u0026#39; of the NMDAR 2A and 2B subunits (Johnston et al., 2009). Activation of the NMDAR also enhances brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) release, which promotes neuronal survival, differentiation and synaptogenesis (Tyler et al., 2002; Johnston et al., 2009). Consequently, the blockage of NMDAR by chemical substances during synaptogenesis disrupts neuronal network formation resulting in the impairment of learning and memory processes (Toscano and Guilarte, 2005).

This AOP describes the sequence of key events (KEs) that occur in rats and mice following\u0026nbsp;chronic exposure to CAR activators, which leads from activation of CAR to an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. The molecular initiating event (MIE) is activation of the CAR nuclear receptor, either by direct binding of a ligand or by an indirect mechanism (e.g. as with phenobarbital), both of which allow the CAR protein to translocate to\u0026nbsp;the nucleus and alter expression of CAR target genes. In rats and mice, CAR activation alters the expression of certain genes related to cell cycle control, producing changes resulting in a pro-proliferative and anti-apoptotic environment. These gene expression changes (KE1) lead to an increase in mitogenic cell proliferation (KE2). In this proliferative environment, a higher number of spontaneously mutated hepatocytes can form. \u0026nbsp;With longer time intervals, the mutated hepatocytes clonally expand into pre-neoplastic altered foci (KE2). Eventually, under continued CAR activation, the pre-neoplastic foci expand to form hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas, the adverse outcome (AO). Based on a wide dataset of testing with CAR activators, this AOP is considered to only be operative in mice and rats, and not in other mammalian species including humans. Good dose concordance between the early KEs,\u0026nbsp;associated biological markers of the\u0026nbsp;KEs\u0026nbsp;and the AO have been demonstrated with example molecules. A potential application of this AOP is to guide future risk assessments, where dose-response values for critical early key events, e.g. NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) or BMDL (Benchmark Dose Lower Limit) values, may be useful endpoints. Another potential application of this AOP is to highlight how methods for assessment of the MIE and/or the early KEs can be reliably used to demonstrate that a CAR mode of action is operative for a particular molecule, avoiding large scale use of animal testing to demonstrate every KE in the proposed pathway.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/107.json"},{"id":40,"title":"Covalent Protein binding leading to Skin Sensitisation","short_name":"Skin Sensitisation AOP","corresponding_author":{"id":330,"email":"sharon.munn@ec.europa.eu","created_at":"2013-05-02T12:34:38.000-04:00","updated_at":"2016-11-29T18:41:15.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eSkin sensitisation is a term used to denote the regulatory hazards known as human allergic contact dermatitis or rodent contact hypersensitivity, an important health endpoint taken into consideration in hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. Skin sensitisation is an immunological process that is described in two phases: the induction of sensitisation and the subsequent elicitation of the immune reaction. The first phase includes a sequential set of events which are described in this Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP). The molecular initiating event (MIE) is covalent binding to skin proteins (specifically, to cysteine and/or lysine residues) which leads to keratinocytes\u0026#39; activation, a key event (KE) at cellular level. Another key event at cellular level is activation of dendritic cells, which is caused by hapten-protein complexes as well as by signalling from activated keratinocytes. Dendritic cells subsequently mature and migrate out of the epidermis to the local lymph node where they display major histocompatibility complex molecules, which include part of the hapten-protein complex to naive T-lymphocytes (T-cells). This induces differentiation and proliferation of allergen chemical-specific memory T-cells. This signifies the consecutive KE resulting in the acquisition of sensitisation, the adverse outcome on organ level. A sensitised subject has the capacity then to mount a more accelerated secondary response to the same chemical.

Protein adduct formation is the interaction between a chemical, or reactive metabolite, and a protein at molecular level. During this interaction a covalent bond is formed which occurs due to the reaction between an electrophilic chemical and the nucleophilic part of a protein. When a chemical forms a covalent bond with a protein the protein is damaged and can loses its function. Acetaldehyde, the metabolite of ethanol, is also one of these chemicals known to form protein adducts. This is why protein adduct formation is added in this AOP based on ethanol. CYP2E1 is one of the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of ethanol, and because of this metabolic activity the MIE in added in this AOP. CYP2E1 participates in the metabolism of endogenous, small and hydrophobic compounds using a oxidation reaction. CYP2E1 is mainly expressed in rat liver cells, but can also be found in rat brain cells. Furthermore, in the human brain CYP2E1 expression is mainly found in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. At higher concentrations of ethanol the expression of CYP2E1 increases, as well as the activity of CYP2E1 since it has a relatively high Km value for ethanol. In this AOP\u0026nbsp;four different KEs are used, which are oxidative stress (KE1), lipid peroxidation (KE2), unfolded protein response (UPR) (KE3) and apoptosis (KE4). Oxidative stress can be defined as the imbalance between ROS and defence mechanisms against these ROS. ROS levels in a cell can rise which leads to damage by the oxidizing free radicals. Lipid peroxidation is a form of direct damage to lipids in the cell membrane or organelle membranes. The cell membrane will eventually break due to the build-up of all the damage. MDA\u0026nbsp; and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) are two products of lipid peroxidation. UPR is a reaction activated by stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). ER stress can be induced by too much protein folding which reaches a higher level than the folding capacity. Also accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER and protein adducts formation with important endoplasmic proteins can induce ER stress, which activates UPR. The final KE is apoptosis, which is programmed cell death in general. The process of apoptosis is well regulated and several signal proteins are known to induce the apoptotic process.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/260.json"},{"id":220,"title":"Cyp2E1 Activation Leading to Liver Cancer","short_name":"Cyp2E1 Activation Leading to Liver Cancer","corresponding_author":{"id":443,"email":"francina.webster@canada.ca","created_at":"2017-05-30T10:21:04.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-12-05T16:01:16.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\"\u003eCyp2E1 is a cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase that bioactivates over 85 substrates, thereby creating electrophilic metabolites and oxidative stress. Substrates are low molecular weight compounds that include acetone, acetaminophen, ethanol, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, furan and molecular oxygen. Mono-oxygenation of these substrates to their reactive metabolites, and the accompanying oxidative stress produced during metabolism, pose health risks because they lead to hepatotoxicity and, often, to liver cancer. Here we describe the AOP for the chronic activation of Cyp2E1 (MIE) leading to liver cancer (AO). The intervening KEs are oxidative stress (KE1), cytotoxicity (KE2), and regenerative proliferation (KE3). These events occur in the liver, which is the primary site of xenobiotic metabolism in the body. Briefly, the MIE occurs when Cyp2E1 binds a substrate. The Cyp2E1 catalytic cycle is prone to decoupling (adjacent KER1, non-adjacent KER1), which produces oxidative stress (KE1), and mono-oxidation of substrates produces reactive metabolites. Both reactive oxygen species and metabolites cause cytotoxicity (KE2). However, following injury, the liver is able to regenerate itself through an increase in cellular proliferation (KE3). Under conditions of chronic activation of Cyp2E1, excessive chronic increases in levels of reactive oxygen species and cell death, and subsequent dysregulated cellular proliferation, leads to tumour formation (AO). We evaluate the essentiality of the KEs and the biological plausibility of and empirical support for the KERs and report that most are well supported by a large body of scientific literature. Here, we\u0026rsquo;ve focused on data generated in rodent studies using the Cyp2E1 substrates carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, ethanol and furan. These compounds are all liver carcinogens, but generate negative or equivocal results in short-term genotoxicity tests. In fact, they are widely thought to cause cancer through a cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation mode of action. We expect that the data and information summarized here will be useful to scientists and regulators that are investigating chemical carcinogens that act through this mechanism. Given the importance of oxidative stress and cytotoxicity in a broad array of toxicological effects, the KE(R)s described should be broadly useful for development of other AOPs. Finally, this AOP describes an important widely acknowledged pathway to toxicity and thus should have many regulatory applications. Further development of the quantitative aspects of this AOP will enable the development of more predictive models of effects resulting from oxidative stress.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/220.json"},{"id":109,"title":"Cytotoxicity leading to bronchioloalveolar adenomas and carcinomas (in mouse)","short_name":"Cytotoxicity- bronchiolar adenoma/carcinoma","corresponding_author":{"id":319,"email":"wood.charles@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-08-18T16:59:44.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-04-17T09:41:23.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) outlines potential key events leading to a tumor outcome in standard carcinogenicity models.

Elucidating an AOP for embryonic vascular disruption must consider the stepwise events underlying blood vessel patterning. Vascular development commences in the early embryo with in situ formation of nascent vessels from angioblasts, leading to a primary capillary plexus (vasculogenesis). After the onset of blood circulation, the primary vascular pattern is further expanded as new vessels sprout from pre-existing vessels (angiogenesis). Both processes, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, are regulated by genetic signals and environmental factors dependent on anatomical region, physiological state, and developmental stage of the embryo. The developing vascular network is further shaped into a hierarchical system of arteries and veins, through progressive effects on blood vessel arborization, branching, and pruning (angioadaptation). These latter influences include hemodynamic forces, regional changes in blood flow, local metabolic demands and growth factor signals. Disruptions in embryonic vascular patterning-adaptation may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including birth defects, angiodysplasias and cardiovascular disease, intrauterine growth restriction or prenatal death. Some chemicals may act as potential vascular disrupting compounds (pVDCs) altering the expression, activity or function of molecular signals regulating blood vessel development and remodeling. Critical pathways involve receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., growth factor-signaling), G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., chemokine signaling), and GPI-anchored receptors (e.g. uPAR system).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eDESCRIPTION: This AOP focuses on the regulation and disruption of vasculogenesis-angiogenesis during embryonic development via disruption of the VEGF-signaling pathway. VEGFA binding to its cognate receptor (VEGFR2) triggers angiogenic sprouting, growth and fusion during early development, and in flow-sensing adaptation of vascular development during later development. VEGFR2 inhibition, the postulated molecular initiating event (MIE) for this AOP, may be invoked by effects on VEGFA production, mobility, or receptor binding, and by effects on VEGFR2 cellular expression, molecular function or post-receptor signal transduction pathways. Downstream key events (KE) include altered cell fate and behavior of \u0026#39;endothelial tip cells\u0026#39; (exploratory behavior, cell migration) and endothelial \u0026#39;stalk cells\u0026#39; (cell proliferation, apoptosis). KE relationships (KERs) leading to vascular insufficiency then involve local interactions with other cell types (stromal cells, macrophages), the extracellular matrix (ECM) and micro-physiology (hemodynamics, metabolism). Adverse outcomes (AO) would ultimately vary by anatomical region, organ system, gestational stage and state of the embryo, fetus or placenta when an MIE is invoked.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eRELEVANCE and APPLICATION: Angiogenesis and vascular disruption is a broad concept. The intended use of this AOP in a regulatory context is the predictive toxicology of developmental hazards, especially for integrating data from high-throughput screening (HTS) assays into cell agent-based models for predicting dysmorphogenesis. As part of an integrated assessment of toxicity, this AOP can identify useful information for assessing adverse outcomes relevant to risk assessment and efficient use of resources for validation through predictive models linking developmental toxicity to vascular disruption. AOP-based computer models that simulate vascular development can usher-in new virtual screening techniques to predict what might happen to a developing embryo when exposed to chemicals across different dose-time-stage scenarios, including the range of effects and how cellular injury propagates across development.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/43.json"},{"id":240,"title":"DNA Adducts Leading to Liver Hemangiosarcoma","short_name":"DNA Adduct-mediated Liver Hemangiosarcoma","corresponding_author":{"id":157,"email":"jarabek.annie@epa.gov","created_at":"2016-01-27T15:40:24.000-05:00","updated_at":"2016-11-29T18:41:12.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/240.json"},{"id":290,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to reduced fecundity associated population decline","short_name":"DNMT inhibition leading to reduced fecundity associated population decline","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"email":"yso@niva.no","created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-08-13T04:42:37.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/290.json"},{"id":291,"title":"DNA methyltransferase inhibition leading to transgenerational DNA methylation associated population decline","short_name":"DNMT inhibition leading to transgenerational DNA methylation associated population decline","corresponding_author":{"id":322,"email":"yso@niva.no","created_at":"2016-06-30T07:13:47.000-04:00","updated_at":"2019-08-13T04:42:37.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/291.json"},{"id":193,"title":"Dual oxidase (DUOX) inhibition leading to altered amphibian metamorphosis","short_name":"DUOX inhib alters metamorphosis","corresponding_author":{"id":142,"email":"haselman.jon@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-07-24T10:53:28.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-26T10:23:35.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/193.json"},{"id":167,"title":"Early-life estrogen receptor activity leading to endometrial carcinoma in the mouse.","short_name":"Early onset ER activity and endometrial carcinoma","corresponding_author":{"id":319,"email":"wood.charles@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-08-18T16:59:44.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-04-17T09:41:23.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) outlines potential key events leading to a tumor outcome in standard carcinogenicity models.

The molecular initiating event (MIE) is gestational estrogen receptor (ER) activation; particularly, stromal activation at in utero time of exposure. The ER is a master transcriptional regulator, with proliferation as its primary effect, and is the main mediator of breast development [24, 25]. Human-relevant EDC exposure triggers transcriptional activity that promotes altered signaling between the epithelial and stromal tissue compartments leading to disrupted tensional homeostasis [26] and tissue architecture. Inflammation and altered cellular differentiation are major cell- and tissue-level key events (KEs) mediating these disruptions. The pathway converges on the following mammary gland adverse outcomes (AOs) at the tissue- and organ-levels: altered density, structure and hormone sensitivity along with hyperplasia. Epigenetic alterations are a cellular-level AO that propagate gestational EDC exposure to later-life risk through cellular memory that directs ER-mediated gene expression and altered mammary development. Risk of tumorigenesis follows from these AOs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe industrial estrogen, bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most data-rich chemicals related to breast cancer and altered mammary gland development [11]. As such, studies in model rodent strains following gestational EDC exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) or DES provide experimental support for this AOP and human-relevance. A thorough search of the literature yielded experimental evidence for this AOP as directed by a mix of natural and MeSH term search logic specifying rodents and non-human primates (population); human-relevant, in utero exposure to BPA or DES (exposure); and mammary gland AOs (outcome) [27-32] (see PECO statement, Table 1 below). Most studies investigating EDC-effects on mammary development heavily describe altered growth and structure, resulting in limited mechanistic understanding. This AOP integrates knowledge and tools from investigations of established breast cancer risk factors such as density and obesity to enhance understanding of the molecular- and cellular-driven etiologies of altered mammary structure and growth. Integrating this knowledge promotes the development of in vitro assays capable of predicting high-risk phenotypes and offers efficient alternatives to in vivo mammary gland evaluation. Ultimately, making these links in the knowledge base will improve screening to identify chemicals that act on gestational development and will more specifically target chemical contributions to later-life breast cancer risk in toxicity testing. Productive intermediate testing endpoints would follow ER-binding, -activation and steroidogenesis (OECD TG-455; EDSP TG-890[33, 34]), precede carcinogenicity (OECD TG-451, and -453) and connect these with EDC-effects on breast cancer due to prenatal exposure (OECD TG-414, -415, -416, -422, -443). This AOP will also describe \u0026lsquo;missed opportunities\u0026rsquo; in the existing evidence; not reporting or measuring traditional toxicity testing endpoints, like uterine weight and body weight alongside more sensitive mammary gland growth and structural changes. Failure to do this in parallel within the same study undermines the sensitivity of these endpoints to predict later-life breast cancer risk.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTable 1.\u0026nbsp;PECO statement [27, 28].\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e A statement of the Population, Exposure, Comparators and Outcomes was prepared to direct objective experimental study collection for this AOP synthesis on breast cancer risk from early-life EDC exposure. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development does not cite systematic review methods or objective identification of included evidence in its guidance for AOP development. A narrowed survey of review articles in PubMed, published after 2006 and until November 2018, was performed to assess the state of mechanistic evidence connecting EDC exposure to breast cancer risk and altered mammary gland growth and structure. This step assisted problem formulation by situating human-relevant EDC exposures in the hallmarks of cancer via \u0026lsquo;important reviews.\u0026rsquo; There were no systematic reviews.

During a molt cycle, the animals generate new exoskeletons by the epidermis and shed the old ones in order to grow. Successful molting is key to survival, development and reproduction. Over half a century research on arthropod endocrinology reveals that molting is precisely controlled by complex multi-hormone systems, with 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) being the key effective hormone to mediate different biological processes that are necessary for molting. The hormonal actions of 20E are exerted through binding and modulation of the ecdysone receptors (EcR), which are nuclear transcriptional factors that regulate a wide range of physiological and behavioral changes. Based on this knowledge, endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) targeting at the EcRs are developed as pesticides and anti-parasite pharmaceuticals in order to disrupt the molting cycles of \u0026ldquo;harmful\u0026rdquo; arthropods and protect the agriculture and aquaculture. However, environmental residues of these EDCs may also affect non-target species, such as a number of crustaceans (e.g. crabs and lobsters) with great ecological and economical values, due to highly conserved endocrine systems in arthropods. Substantial efforts are therefore needed to assess the environmental hazards and risks of EDCs on non-target species. Due to the high number (over a million described) of species in the phylum of \u003cem\u003eArthopoda\u003c/em\u003e, it is not feasible to perform toxicity testing for each species as well as EDC. Construction of universal models on basis of systems (eco)toxicology and phylogenetic similarities for understanding the environmental endocrine disruption (ED) effects may serve as a potential solution.

The majority (approximately 75 percent) of breast cancer cases express the estrogen receptor. Both animal and human studies strongly support that activation of the estrogen receptor stimulates breast cancer development and progression. We created the ER-mediated breast cancer AOP to frame how ER activation (the MIE) leads to breast cancer (the AO). For more information regarding the AOP, refer to the Morgan \u0026amp; Johnson et al. (2015) citation.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eActivation of the estrogen receptor in breast epithelial cells stimulates genomic and non-genomic changes, which alters epithelial gene expression and subsequent protein production. Consequently, breast epithelial cells experience increased proliferation, decreased apoptosis, dysfunction of mitochondrial dynamics, increased DNA damage, increased cell motility, and increased oxidative stress. These cellular changes translate to a tissue level where ductal hyperplasia and cell invasion is increased.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWhile breast epithelial cells are the cancer cell type in ER+ adenocarcinomas, other cell types of the microenvironment interact with the AOP. For example, endothelial cells express ER and upon ER activation, undergo gene expression and protein production changes. Consequently, endothelial cell proliferation and migration is increased, leading to increased angiogenesis, which supports the proliferation of breast cancer epithelial cells. While estrogens do not target fibroblasts, adipocytes, or macrophages directly, they become activated as breast cancer progresses. It is not well understood if there is a direct relationship between estrogen signaling and stromal cell activation, however, activated cells stimulate cancer cell proliferation, influence chemical response, increase cell motility, and rearrange the extracellular matrix. Moreover, adipocytes contribute to the AOP through metabolism of testosterone to estrogen, and fibroblasts have been shown to regulate estrogen receptor regulated genes in epithelial cells. Therefore, due to how the breast microenvironment interacts with and stimulates the AOP, we have included activation of these cell types into our framework.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, the ER-mediated breast cancer AOP is a useful framework that can identify both readouts and components of the breast microenvironment that are important in disease progression.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/200.json"},{"id":29,"title":"Estrogen receptor agonism leading to reproductive dysfunction","short_name":"Estrogen receptor agonism leading to reproductive dysfunction","corresponding_author":{"id":305,"email":"tom.hutchinson@plymouth.ac.uk","created_at":"2014-01-14T10:22:57.000-05:00","updated_at":"2016-11-29T18:41:14.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis AOP describes the linkages between agonism of the estrogen receptor (ER) and population relevant impacts on reproductive function in a range of oviparous vertebrates including amphibia, birds and fish.

Larvae exposed to ER agonists during mid-metamorphosis show developmental effects, a subsequent strong female-biased sex ratio which suggests that transient early life-stage exposure to ER agonists can produce effects on the reproductive organs that persist into the beginning of adult life-stages.  Birds are also known to be vulnerable to ER agonists causing disruption of estrogen-regulated functions such as sexual differentiation and sexual behaviour.  Model species such as the Japanese quail have been widely used as a model for studying various long-term effects after embryonic exposure to ER agonists.  In terms of teleost fish, exposure to ER agonists leads to a suite of adverse outcomes depending upon whether exposures occur during or beyond the larval, juvenile and adult life-stages.  For example,  aquatic exposure to potent ER agonists during the larval and juvenile life-stages may leads to gonadal and renal pathology and skewed-sex ratios in adult fish (potentially 100% females).  Larval, juvenile and adult male fish exposed to the same ER agonists display abnormal plasma or whole body levels of vitellogenin (VTG).

HDAC inhibition during embryonic development has been correlated to several congenital malformations mainly affecting neurodevelopment. However, the kind of malformation strongly depends on the timing of disturbance, i.e. when during embryonic development the exposure occurred. This AOP concentrates on disturbances by HDAC inhibition during the first weeks of neurodevelopment, before or around the time point of neural tube closure. Therefore, this AOP suggests a mechanism how HDAC inhibitors could lead to the observed neural tube defects.

Lung fibrosis is a dysregulated or an exaggerated tissue repair process. It denotes the presence of scar tissue in the alveolar capillary region of the lung where gas exchange occurs; it can be localised or more diffuse involving bronchi and pleura. The process involves intricate dynamics between several inflammatory and immune response cells, and the microenvironment of the alveolar-capillary membrane consisting of both immune and non-immune cells, and the lung interstitium, in the presence of sustained or repeated toxicant stimuli. Regardless of the type of stimulus, the interaction between the substance and components of the cellular membrane leading to release of danger signals/alarmins marks the first event, which is a molecular initiating event (MIE) in the process of tissue repair. As a consequence, a myriad of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators are secreted (Key Event (KE) 1) that signal the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells into the lungs (KE2). The MIE, KE1, and KE2 represent the same functional changes that are collectively known as inflammation, the purpose of which is to clear the invading pathogen or toxic substance. In the presence of continuous stimulus or persistent toxic substances, tissue injury ensues leading to the alveolar capillary membrane integrity loss (KE3) and activation of adaptive immune response. The purpose of the adaptive immune response is to resolve the inflammation and initiate healing process, involving activation of the T Helper type 2 cell signalling (KE4), during which anti-inflammatory and pro-repair/fibrotic molecules continue to be secreted. Once the healing process is initiated, fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation is induced (KE5) leading to synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix or collagen (KE6). Exaggerated collagen deposition leads to alveolar septa thickening, decrease in total lung volume, and lung fibrosis (Adverse Outcome). It is important to note that many of the individual KEs occur in parallel, early after exposure to fibrogenic stimuli and thus, it is difficult to establish key event relationships (KERs). The eventual clinical manifestation of the disease is influenced by the physical-chemical properties of the substance and duration of exposure.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eLung fibrosis can be induced by many substances, microorganisms or by over expression of specific inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and chemokines.

Lung fibrosis occurs in humans and the key biological events involved are similar as the ones observed in animals.

As structural analogs of substrate nucleotides, these drugs act as chain terminators of viral DNA synthesis via competitive inhibition of reverse transcriptase or viral DNA polymerases, thereby blocking virus replication. Besides targeting viral enzymes, nucleos(t)ide antiviral agents are also substrates for human DNA polymerases, which may lead to moderate to life-threatening adverse drug reactions, including peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, lactic acidosis, and acute and chronic kidney injury [1-4]. Toxicity of antiviral nucleos(t)ides has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction as a consequence of inhibition of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (Pol gamma), a particular sensitive target, and associated inhibition of mtDNA replication [1, 3]. In the kidney, the proximal tubule is the main target of antiviral nucleos(t)ide drug toxicity due to active uptake via basolateral organic anion transporters (e.g. OAT1 and OAT3) expressed at this site [5, 6].

Chemical inhibition of TPO, the molecular-initiating event (MIE), results in decreased thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis, and subsequent reduction in circulating concentrations of THs. THs are essential for normal human brain development, both prenatally and postnatally, modulating genes critical for a normal neuroanatomical development, with subsequent effects on neurophysiology, and finally neurological function. Therefore, chemicals that interfere with TH synthesis have the potential to cause TH insufficiency that may result in adverse neurodevelopmental effects in offspring. Herein, we discuss the implications of developmental TPO inhibition for hippocampal anatomy, function, and ultimately neural function controlled by the hippocampus. The biochemistry of TPO and its essentiality for TH synthesis is well known across species. The hippocampus is known to be critically involved in cognitive, emotional, and memory function. The adverse consequences of TH insufficiency depend both on severity and developmental timing, indicating that exposure to TPO inhibitors may produce different effects at different developmental windows of exposure. It is important to note that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is not a KE in this AOP. While TSH may play a role in feedback-driven compensatory processes, it is not directly involved in brain development. The overall weight of evidence for this AOP is strong.

Reductions in cellular pH sufficient to denature or alter key cellular apparatus (enzymes, proteins) cause cytotoxicity.

Initial development of this AOP is based largely on IYD literature of clinical evidence in humans, rat model experiments, and biochemical and genetic analyses. The enzyme IYD catalyzes the recycling of iodide from the byproducts of thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis [monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT)] within the thyroid gland as well as other organs, including liver and kidney. IYD protects against excretion of critical iodide and promotes accumulation of iodide in thyroid follicular cells for TH synthesis, which is especially critical for low iodine diets and low iodine environments (including most freshwater ecosystems). Therefore, failure or chemical inhibition of IYD could reduce TH synthesis, resulting in TH insufficiency in tissues and subsequent altered development. Failure of this enzyme in humans, due to mutations in the IYD gene (DEHAL1), has been shown to have negative developmental consequences, including hypothyroidism, goiter, and mental retardation. In rat exposures with suspected IYD inhibitors, serum T4 and T3 were reduced, thyroid gland size and TSH increased, and weight gain was reduced. Additionally, IYD has been shown to be a potential chemical target for thyroid axis disruption through in vitro inhibition assays with polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, agrichemicals, antiparasitics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants.

Daphniids normally go through parthenogenic reproduction cycles in which only female offspring are produced. When under environmental stress (e.g. chemical exposure, short length of daylight, food shortage and high population density), a switch of reproductive strategy from asexual to sexual reproduction occurs and male offspring are produced. As an indicator of ED, the induction of male offspring is used as an important endpoint in daphnia toxicity tests. It has been widely recognized that analogs of the crustacean juvenile hormone (JH), methyl farnesoate (MF) are able to bind and activate the crustacean JH receptor, methoprene tolerant (Met), thus inducing the putative sex determination genes, doublesex genes, and causing male offspring formation. The induction of male neonates is usually associated with reduced fecundity and population decline as adverse ED effects.

These ions are a central component of a complex system of intracellular messenger that mediates a wide range of biological processes. In the heart, calcium dynamics and signaling are essential for cardiac muscle contraction, thus the perturbation of these processes may impair organ function and health. Different types of calcium channels contribute to the timely regulation of calcium currents at the cellular level. Among them, the L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) are responsible for the excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal, smooth, and cardiac muscle. The pharmacological modulation of this target is an important tool for the treatment of cardiac pathologies, and several drugs that block LTCCs have been developed in the last few decades.

The AOP development was based on over 1,100 in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo data points extracted from approximately 150 publications that investigated a) the effects of calcium channel blockers on different components of the cardiovascular system, and b) the effects of genetic manipulations of the drug target. For each Key Event (KE), a quantitative analysis was performed to determine effect direction and degree of responsiveness. A database-specific confidence index was assigned to each KE according to the degree of reproducibility of the effect. Many KEs of this AOP can be experimentally quantified using different specific endpoints. Therefore, the responsiveness analysis of each endpoint was performed to quantify the sensitivity of each measurement to the blockade of LTCCs. This knowledge has both biological and methodological significance. In the latter case, it can effectively inform the development of suitable testing strategies aimed at maximizing the probability to detect changes in a given KE.

If the alveolus stays closed, this reduces the lung volume (KE6), reducing the area for gas exchange in the lungs and reduces blood oxygenation (KE7). If the alveolus reopens (KE3), this can lead to loss of barrier function due to shear stress on the epithelium (KE4) and bleeding into the lungs (KE5).

The importance of steatosis is highlighted from the fact that it is a prerequisite for the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a clinicopathological condition that comprises a wide spectrum of liver damage, ranging from steatosis alone to steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. \nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents only a stage in the spectrum of NAFLD and is defined pathologically by the presence of steatosis together with necro-inflammatory activity. The clinical implications of NAFLD are derived mostly from its potential to progress to end-stage liver disease, whereas simple uncomplicated steatosis follows a relatively benign course in most patients. \nSteatosis is the output of the disturbance on the homeostasis of hepatic lipids which depends on the dynamic balance of several pathways including fatty acid (FA) uptake, de novo FA synthesis, β-oxidation, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. It is characterized by the accumulation of lipid droplets (mainly triglycerides) in the hepatocytes.\nThis AOP describes the linkage between hepatic steatosis triggered by nuclear receptors activation (PPAR gamma and LXR) through modulation of genes responsible for lipid homeostasis [the carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), the sterol response element binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c),  the free fatty acid uptake transporter FAT/CD36, the fatty acid synthase (FAS),  the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1)] which subsequently leasds to in rease of de novo fatty acids/triglycerides synthesis and fat influx from the peripheral tissues to liver. The accumulation of lipid in the hepatocytes can cause cytoplasm displacement, nucleus distortion, mitochondrial toxicity and eventually necrosis and/or apoptosis. The progression of this condition can lead to tissue inflammation (steatohepatitis) and fibrosis with the involvement of other cells of the hepatic tissue like the Kupffer (inflammation) and the stellate (fibrosis) cells.\nThis purely qualitative AOP description is plausible, the scientific data supporting the AOP are logic, coherent and consistent and there is temporal agreement between the individual KEs. Quantitative data on dose-response-relationships and temporal sequences between key events are still lacking; the provision of quantitative data will strengthen the weight of evidence and make the AOP applicable for chemical risk assessment purposes.\n\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/34.json"},{"id":222,"title":"Mental stress to agitation","short_name":"Mental stress to agitation","corresponding_author":{"id":56,"email":"burgoon.lyle@gmail.com","created_at":"2014-03-03T12:01:56.000-05:00","updated_at":"2017-11-27T12:03:42.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/222.json"},{"id":221,"title":"Mental stress to depression","short_name":"Mental stress to depression","corresponding_author":{"id":56,"email":"burgoon.lyle@gmail.com","created_at":"2014-03-03T12:01:56.000-05:00","updated_at":"2017-11-27T12:03:42.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/221.json"},{"id":279,"title":"Microtubule interacting drugs lead to peripheral neuropathy","short_name":"Microtubule interacting drugs lead to peripheral neuropathy","corresponding_author":{"id":410,"email":"marvin.martens@maastrichtuniversity.nl","created_at":"2017-03-10T05:23:56.000-05:00","updated_at":"2019-08-07T08:52:08.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003ePeripheral neuropathy is regularly observed as a side-effect in microtubule-targeted chemotherapies.

OXPHOS perturbation will manifest as lower or no production of ATP via the mitochondria.

Damage then occurs to red blood cells (RBCs) and methemoglobinemia ensues which is characterized by reduced RBCs, hemoglobin concentration, and Heinz body formation (Ellis et al. 1985, Lee et al. 1976, 1978, Hazleton Laboratories 1977, 1982, Kozuka et al. 1978, 1979, Bolt et al. 2006). The adverse outcome due to such hematological effects is cyanosis with possible death if methemoglobin levels become severe.    Hemoglobin adducts are also formed by these chemicals (Sabbioni et al. 2006). Sinusoidal congestion was noted in animals who were exposed to 2,4-DNT or 2,6-DNT (Deng et al. 2011) while hemosiderosis was reported in another study involving DNT (Lee et al. 1978) and in aniline studies. A compensatory response to possible anemic effects has been observed in animals including increased peripheral reticulocytes (Deng et al. 2011) and induction of genes associated with heme biosynthesis (CPOX and UROS) (Rawat et al. 2010). Oxidative stress is also induced upon this interaction with the RBC which may lead to DNA damage and cell death to not only the RBC but other cells such as hepatocytes (Deng et al. 2011). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6pd) was found to be significantly down-regulated in animals treated with 2,4-DNT for 14 d which leads to decreased levels of NADPH, a coenzyme used to properly maintain glutathione levels and therefore protect cells, especially RBC, from oxidative damage (Wilbanks, et al., unpublished observations). In response to increased oxidative stress, protective mechanisms such as the Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress response may be induced (Deng et al. 2011). While this AOP specifically shows effects of 2,4-DNT and 2,6-DNT, the principal adverse pathways of oxidation of Fe(II) to Fe(III) leading to methemoglobinemia and its downsteam effects and oxidative stress formation leading to its downstream effects are shared with the more well characterized structurally similar compound group of N-hydroxyl anilines.\n\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/31.json"},{"id":296,"title":"Oxidative DNA damage leading to chromosomal aberrations and mutations","short_name":"Oxidative DNA damage, chromosomal aberrations and mutations","corresponding_author":{"id":61,"email":"carole.yauk@hc-sc.gc.ca","created_at":"2013-12-16T13:44:19.000-05:00","updated_at":"2019-08-20T11:39:07.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis adverse outcome pathway (AOP) network describes the linkage between oxidative DNA damage and irreversible genomic damage (chromosomal aberrations and mutations).

Mutations can occur in coding and non-coding regions of the genome and can be functional or silent. The site and type of mutation will determine its consequence.

DNA in any cell type is susceptible to oxidative damage due to endogenous (e.g., aerobic respiration) and exogenous (i.e., exposure to oxidants) oxidative insults. Although this is the MIE for this AOP network, we note that there are numerous upstream key events (KE) that can also lead to DNA oxidation. Thus, we expect this AOP to be expanded upstream, and to be incorporated into a variety of AOP networks. Generally, cells are able to tolerate and readily repair oxidative DNA lesions by basal repair mechanisms. However, excessive damage can override the basal repair capacity and lead to inadequate repair of oxidative damage (KE1). Mutations (AO1) can arise from incorrect repair of oxidative lesions (KE1), where incorrect bases are inserted opposite lesions during DNA replication. Insufficiently or incompletely repaired oxidative DNA lesions can also lead to DNA strand breaks (KE2)\u0026nbsp;that, if insufficiently repaired (KE1), may result in chromosome aberrations (AO2) and/or mutations (AO1) following DNA replication.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eSupport for this AOP is strong based on extensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in this pathway, evidence of essentiality of certain KE (i.e., studies using reactive oxidative species scavengers and modulating DNA repair enzymes), and a robust set of studies providing empirical support for many of the KERs.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eWe anticipate that this AOP will be of widespread use to the regulatory community as oxidative DNA damage is considered an important contributor to the adverse health effects of many environmental toxicants.

The molecular and cellular events by which PPARa activators induce rodent hepatocarcinogenesis have been extensively studied and elucidated. The weight of evidence relevant to the hypothesized AOP for PPARa activator-induced rodent hepatocarcinogenesis is summarized here. Chemical-specific and mechanistic data support concordance of temporal and dose\u0026ndash;response relationships for the key events associated with many PPARa activators including a phthalate ester plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and the drug gemfibrozil. The key events (KE) identified are KE1\u0026ndash;PPARa activation, KE2\u0026ndash;alteration in cell growth pathways, KE3\u0026ndash;perturbation of cell growth and survival including increases in cell proliferation and effects on apoptosis, KE4\u0026ndash;selective clonal expansion of preneoplastic foci cells, which lead to the Adverse Outcome\u0026ndash;increases in hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas. A number of molecular events were identified which were initially evaluated as possible key events. However, the data were not convincing for these to be key events in the MOA. Rather, although not causal these modulating factors were considered to have the potential to alter the ability of PPARa activators to increase liver cancer. These modulating events include increases in oxidative stress, activation of NF-kB, and inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication. While biologically plausible in humans, the hypothesized key events in the rodent MOA, for PPARa activators, are unlikely to induce liver tumors in humans because of biological differences in responses. This conclusion is based on minimal or no effects observed on growth pathways, hepatocellular proliferation and liver tumors in humans and/or species (including hamsters, guinea pigs and cynomolgous monkeys) that are more appropriate human surrogates than mice and rats at overlapping dose levels.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/37.json"},{"id":163,"title":"PPARgamma activation leading to sarcomas in rats, mice, and hamsters","short_name":"PPARgamma-related sarcomas","corresponding_author":{"id":319,"email":"wood.charles@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-08-18T16:59:44.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-04-17T09:41:23.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis putative adverse outcome pathway (AOP) outlines potential key events leading to a tumor outcome in standard carcinogenicity models.

The development of this AOP relies on evidence collected from rodent models and incorporates human mechanistic and epidemiological data. The PPAR\u0026alpha; is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor family, which also includes the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. The hypothesis that PPAR\u0026alpha; action is the mechanistic basis for effects on the reproductive system arises from limited experimental data indicating relationships between activation of this receptor and impairment of steroidogenesis leading to reproductive toxicity. PPARs play important roles in the metabolic regulation of lipids, of which cholesterol, in particular, being a precursor of steroid hormones, makes the link between lipid metabolism to effects on reproduction. The key events in the pathway comprise the activation of PPAR\u0026alpha;, followed by the disruption cholesterol transport in mitochondria, impairment of hormonal balance which leads to malformation of the reproductive tract in males which may lead to impaired fertility. The PPAR\u0026alpha;-initiated AOP to rodent male developmental toxicity is a first step for structuring current knowledge about a mode of action which is neither AR-mediated nor via direct steroidogenesis enzymes inhibition. In the current form the pathway lays a strong basis for linking an endocrine mode of action with an apical endpoint, a prerequisite requirement for the identification of endocrine disrupting chemicals.

Liver fibrosis in particular is an important human health issue associated with chemical exposure and predictive assays are lacking; it is a typical result of chronic or repeated-dose toxic injury and one of the considered endpoints for regulatory purposes. It is a long-term process in which inflammation, tissue destruction, and repair occur simultaneously, together with sustained production of growth factors and fibrogenic cytokines due to a complex interplay between various hepatic cell types, various receptors and signalling pathways which lead to an imbalance between the deposition and degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and a change of ECM composition. Due to this complex situation an adequate cell model is not available and an \u003cem\u003ein vitro\u003c/em\u003e evaluation of fibrogenic potential is therefore not feasible. A sufficiently detailed description of the AOP to liver fibrosis might support chemical risk assessment by indicating early (upstream) markers for downstream events and facilitate a testing strategy without the need for a sophisticated cell model. This systematic and coherent display of currently available mechanistic-toxicological information can serve as a knowledge-based repository for identification/selection/development of \u003cem\u003ein vitro\u003c/em\u003e methods suitable for measuring key events (KEs) and their relationships along the AOP and to facilitate the use of alternative data for regulatory purposes. Identified uncertainties and knowledge gaps can direct future research by priority setting and targeted testing. The KE descriptions can be used for hazard identification and read-across to assess the toxic potential of an untested substance.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis AOP describes the linkage between hepatic injury caused by protein alkylation and the formation of liver fibrosis. The molecular initiating event (MIE) is protein alkylation, leading to structural and functional cell injury and further to cell death, the first KE. Apoptotic hepatocytes undergo genomic DNA fragmentation and formation of apoptotic bodies. Upon engulfment of apoptotic bodies Kupffer cells (KCs) are activated, the next KE along the pathway. Activated KCs are the main source of TGF-\u0026beta;1, the most potent profibrogenic cytokine. TGF-\u0026beta;1 expression therefore is considered a KE that causes the next KE, hepatic stellate cell (HSCs) activation, meaning the transdifferentiation from a quiescent vitamin A\u0026ndash;storing cell to a proliferative and contractile myofibroblast, the central effector in hepatic fibrosis. Activated HSCs cause progressive collagen accumulation, which together with changes in ECM composition signifies the KE on tissue level. The excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins progressively affects the whole organ and alters its normal functioning, which corresponds to liver fibrosis, the adverse outcome (AO).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two further events that play an important role in driving fibrogenesis, namely oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. Both are on-going processes being present throughout the pathway and interconnected with most of the KEs. Hence, they are not classified as KEs themselves and described in the individual KE and key event relationship (KER) descriptions. The inflammatory response plays an important role in driving fibrogenesis, since persistent inflammation precedes fibrosis. Inflammatory signalling stems from injured hepatocytes, activated KCs and HSCs. Inflammatory and fibrogenic cells stimulate each other in amplifying fibrosis. Chemokines and their receptors provoke further fibrogenesis, as well as interacting with inflammatory cells to modify the immune response during injury. Oxidative stress, as well, plays a crucial role in liver fibrogenesis by inducing hepatocyte apoptosis, activation of KCs and HSCs and fuelling inflammation. ROS contributing to oxidative stress are generated by hepatocytes, KCs, HSCs and inflammatory cells.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eThis purely qualitative AOP description is plausible, the scientific data supporting the AOP are logic, coherent and consistent and there is temporal agreement between the individual KEs.

style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"\u003eIn this AOP, the primary trigger for a compound to be considered with respect to potential to create photochemical and photobiological reactions is the absorption of photon energy from light ranging from 290 to 700 nm.\u0026nbsp; The extent of absorption depends on the wavelength of light and the type of absorbing chromophores in the light-exposed tissues. \u0026nbsp;A molecule is excited by absorption of photon energy, and the photoactivated molecule induces photochemical reactions via energy transfer (type I photochemical reaction) and free radical generation (type II photochemical reaction).\u0026nbsp; These photochemical reactions result in generation of radicals and reactive oxygen species, and the reactive species react with biomolecules.\u0026nbsp; Generated radicals of a target chemical bind to DNA and proteins, resulting in formation of these photo-adducts, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), including singlet oxygen and superoxide, induce oxidation of biomolecules.\u0026nbsp; These key events bring inflammatory events in the light-exposed tissues \u003c!--[if supportFields]\u003e\u003cspan

An AOP based on the mode of action (MOA) of rodent liver tumor promotion by dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) has been developed and the weight of evidence (WoE) of key event relationships (KERs) evaluated using evolved Bradford Hill considerations. Dioxins and DLCs are potent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands that cause a range of species-specific adverse outcomes. The occurrence of KEs is necessary for inducing downstream biological responses and KEs may occur at the molecular, cellular, tissue and organ levels. The common convention is that an AOP begins with the toxicant interaction with a biological response element; for this AOP, this initial event is binding of a DLC ligand to the AHR. Data from mechanistic studies, lifetime bioassays and approximately thirty initiation-promotion studies have established a number of substances, including dioxin-like chemicals and indole-3-carbinol from brassica vegetables, as rat liver tumor promoters. Such studies clearly show that sustained AHR activation, weeks or months in duration, is necessary to induce rodent liver tumor promotion; hence, sustained AHR activation is deemed the molecular initiating event (MIE). After this MIE, subsequent KEs are 1) changes in cellular growth homeostasis likely associated with expression changes in a number of genes and observed as development of hepatic foci and decreases in apoptosis within foci; 2) extensive liver toxicity observed as the constellation of effects called toxic hepatopathy; 3) cellular proliferation and hyperplasia in several hepatic cell types. This progression of KEs culminates in the AO, the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas and cholangiolar carcinomas. A rich data set provides both qualitative and quantitative knowledge of the progression of this AOP through KEs and the KERs. Thus, the WoE for this AOP is judged to be strong. Species-specific effects of dioxins and DLCs are well known -- humans are less responsive than rodents and rodent species differ in sensitivity between strains. Consequently, application of this AOP to evaluate potential human health risks must take these differences into account.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003ePlease also see Becker, R.A., Patlewicz, G., Simon, T.W., Rowlands, J.C., Budinsky, R.A. 2015.

Herein, we discuss the implications of developmental TR antagonism for hippocampal anatomy, function, and ultimately neural function controlled by the hippocampus. The biochemistry of normal\u0026nbsp; TR function is well known across species. The hippocampus is known to be critically involved in cognitive, emotional, and memory function. The adverse consequences of TR antagnoism depends the severity, developmental timing, and impacts on different TR isoforms, indicating that exposure to TR antagonoists may produce different effects at different developmental windows of exposure.

Amphibian metamorphosis is mediated by TH and successful completion of metamorphosis is generally required for organism survival.  TPO is a critical enzyme in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway that iodinates tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin and also couples the iodinated tyrosines to form thyroxine (T4).  Conversion of T4 to the active hormone, triiodothyronine (T3), is catalyzed by the major activating enzyme, type II iodothyronine deiodinase (see deiodinase pAOP), located within the peripheral organs and tissues.  T3 then binds to thyroid hormone receptor (THR) along with other cofactors allowing transcriptional gene activation.  This T3-mediated gene expression drives the anatomical and physiological changes encompassed by the metamorphic process including limb emergence and development, lung development, gill and tail resorption, gut remodeling, metabolic profile changes in the liver, skin keratinization, etc.  The weight of evidence for this AOP is strong, as TPO inhibition has been studied extensively in amphibian model species \u003ci\u003eXenopus laevis\u003c/i\u003e during larval development.  Model TPO inhibitors methimazole and 6-propylthiouracil, in addition to other TPO inhibitors such as 2-mercaptobenzothiazole and benzophenone-2, have been tested in this species using several in vivo study designs, some aiming to characterize temporal profiles of glandular hormone levels in addition to serum hormone levels and associated thyroid gland histopathology.  These studies lend strong support for essentiality of events proximal to, and including, the MIE.  Downstream, the relationship between blood and tissue TH levels is driven by a host of active transport proteins that have begun to be characterized in mammalian models, whereas THR-mediated gene expression profiles have been studied extensively in the amphibian model.  However, less is known about quantitative relationships and essentiality of these downstream events, which generally lacks importance due to the strong indirect relationship between circulating hormone levels and delayed metamorphosis.\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003c/p\u003e","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/175.json"},{"id":159,"title":"Thyroperoxidase inhibition leading to reduced young of year survival via anterior swim bladder inflation","short_name":"TPOi anterior swim bladder","corresponding_author":{"id":102,"email":"dries.knapen@uantwerpen.be","created_at":"2014-01-23T11:09:25.000-05:00","updated_at":"2018-12-18T07:53:01.000-05:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/159.json"},{"id":189,"title":"Type I iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1) inhibition leading to altered amphibian metamorphosis","short_name":"DIO1 inhib alters metamorphosis","corresponding_author":{"id":142,"email":"haselman.jon@epa.gov","created_at":"2015-07-24T10:53:28.000-04:00","updated_at":"2018-09-26T10:23:35.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003eThis putative AOP describes an adverse outcome that results from the inhibition of Type I iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO1) during amphibian metamorphosis.

One type of irritation, corrosive irritation causes inflammation from tissue destruction and appears to be limited to inhalation of industrial chemicals for example hydrochloric acid, chlorine gas, and ammonia. The second type, sensory irritation is caused by sensory stimulation mediated by activation of specific receptors located in the trigeminal nerve endings and occurs at concentrations that do not result in tissue destruction. Our focus is to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) for sensory irritants. \u0026nbsp;Many inhalable chemicals are sensory irritants (Alarie et al 1966, 1973, Schaper et al., 1993) that can cause physiological responses including pain, mucus production, nasal obstruction, sneezing, coughing, and decreases in respiration rate (Brunning et al., 2014). The target organ of respiratory irritants is ultimately the airways causing inflammation of the trachea, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis. A receptor present in the upper airways is the TRPA1 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily A, member 1) that induces a physiological response to make the subject aware of the presence of chemicals and initiate several defensive biological responses. A wide range of chemicals activates TRPA1 (Bessac and Jordt, 2010). The activation of TRPA1 acts as a gatekeeper of inflammation/irritation and is a critical endpoint in the regulation of exposure to volatile organic chemicals (Bautista et al., 2013; Lehman et al., 2015).\u003c/p\u003e\r\n","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/196.json"},{"id":182,"title":"Weather event contributes abnormal foraging leading to colony loss/failure","short_name":"Weather to abnormal foraging to colony loss/failure","corresponding_author":{"id":198,"email":"lalone.carlie@epa.gov","created_at":"2014-01-14T10:26:18.000-05:00","updated_at":"2019-06-10T02:38:47.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/182.json"},{"id":181,"title":"Weather event contributes to colony loss/failure","short_name":"Weather to colony loss/failure","corresponding_author":{"id":198,"email":"lalone.carlie@epa.gov","created_at":"2014-01-14T10:26:18.000-05:00","updated_at":"2019-06-10T02:38:47.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"","url":"https://aopwiki.org/aops/181.json"},{"id":298,"title":"Wnt ligand stimulation and Wnt signalling activation lead to cancer malignancy","short_name":"Wnt activation leading to cancer malignancy","corresponding_author":{"id":355,"email":"stanabe@nihs.go.jp","created_at":"2016-12-05T02:52:54.000-05:00","updated_at":"2019-08-26T19:57:31.000-04:00","subscribed":true,"novice":false},"abstract":"\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-family:times; font-size:14.0pt\"\u003eWnt (Wingless and INT-1) ligands stimulate Frizzled receptors and activate Wnt signaling leading to cancer malignancy.
