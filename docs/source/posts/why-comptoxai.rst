We're thrilled to present ComptoxAI - a new resource that's meant to act as a
'home base' for advanced applications of AI in the field of computational
toxicology! A complete set of :ref:`user guides <guides>` and
:ref:`documentation pages <api>` are available on the main site, but we're
writing this post to give a brief introduction to ComptoxAI and illustrate why
it is important to the translational research community.
